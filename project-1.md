# Project 1: WDI 27 

## Introduction


Welcome to my repository for Mode Code,  For the first project for this course I created a web game for classmates to test their knowledge on how well they know each other. It is easy to follow, entertaining to play, and structured simply for those who would like to craft their own specially themed trivia game.

## Installation and Setup

Installation steps are listed below:

* Download or clone this repo
* copy `npm i` into you terminal to install dependencies
* run `gulp` in your terminal to compile the source code and open in browser
* _Enjoy_!

### A short description


WHI 27 Ultimate Trivia Game utilizes many images, gifs, audio files, and a few events.

![Homepage](images/homepage.png)

The game is styled by using multiple divs with the class of hidden. As the player clicks on buttons, the hidden class is added or removed when necessary.

I created two JavaScript files that are easily repurposed for your own trivia game. The sheet _questionStorage.js_ is used for storing questions, their answers, and corresponding media as an array. The sheet _app.js_ stores all of the functions and constants needed to run the game. You can change the timer, number of questions needed to be correct, and all media on this sheet.

To add to the comedic effect, I inputted gifs for each correct answer, and different audio files for when a player submits an answer and for the different stages of the gem: instructions, start, win, lose.
